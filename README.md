### Stranded in the void
Imagine making a README but being too lazy to edit it
Oh well while I already am at it

I mainly specialize in making discord bots, using python
Being an electronics student 

I also "know" C & C++ (aka could write some simple program in, but probably won't use the right tools to do so)
