### Stranded in the void
Imagine making a README but being too lazy to edit it<br>
Oh well while I already am at it

I mainly specialize in making discord bots, using python<br>
Being an electronics student I've also learned the basics of C and C++<br>
Soonâ„¢ I should be able to program microcontrollers and stuff (never done that before)<br>
